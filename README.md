### ETL SCD1 Automation Using Snowflake Tasks, Streams, and Stored Procedures  

Designed and implemented a fully automated Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD1) data pipeline using Snowflake.  
Leveraged Python, AWS S3, and Anaconda notebooks to upload raw and change data files to S3, triggered ingestion through Snowflakeâ€™s Tasks and Streams, and executed SCD1 logic via Stored Procedures.  
Validated updates based on composite primary keys (`CONTACTFIRSTNAME`, `CONTACTLASTNAME`) to ensure in-place updates of customer records and insertion of new ones.  
Results included end-to-end automation of SCD1 processing, near-real-time updates to the customer table, and streamlined integration between cloud storage and Snowflake for scalable ETL execution.

### ETL SCD2 Automation Using DBT and Snowflake   

Designed and implemented an SCD Type 2 data pipeline using DBT Cloud integrated with Snowflake, supporting a full bronze-silver-gold architecture.  
Automated table creation, transformations, and versioned history capture using DBT macros, snapshots, and custom schema layering (silver: transient tables, gold: views).  
Enabled integration with AWS S3 staging and Snowflake file formats, with modular project design and YAML-based configurations for reproducibility and maintainability.

### Data Visualization with Snowflake and Tableau  

Connected Tableau to Snowflake using custom SQL queries to visualize large-scale transactional data from the TPCH_SF1000 sample schema.  
Built interactive dashboards to display:  
- Top 5 customers by order count  
- Top 5 nations by average quantity shipped  
- Monthly order volume and revenue for 1997  

Optimized query performance using `ROW_NUMBER`, aggregation, and efficient joins. Enhanced dashboard readability with labels, colors, and chart types such as bar and area graphs.  
Resulted in faster insights and improved storytelling from Snowflake-hosted data.
